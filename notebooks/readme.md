# Notebooks

This is where we store our notebooks. 

**Note for the team:** The notebooks are meant primarily for data exploration and can be used for training models, but please include your model, data, and other similar classes in the correct directory and import those classes in the notebook. You don't have to worry too much about this while prototyping, but we should work to include all models in the model directory so that we can all grab them from there easily.
