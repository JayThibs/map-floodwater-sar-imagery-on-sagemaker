# Sentinel-1 Dataset from the Driven Data Competition

The competition is hosted by the [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/) team. You can get the data by going to [this](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/81/detect-flood-water/page/385/) competition page, signing up for the competition and going to the "Data Download" tab.

To make it easier to download the data, I created a zip file of all the data and stored it in s3 (you can't simply download from the link on their website with a python request). The link to the stored data in s3 is in the metadata file.
